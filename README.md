## Word-Guess-Game: Space Movies

My interest for space _and_ movies came together for my first game!

## Rules for the Game
In order to play this game, you must press a valid letter on the keyboard.  If you guess correctly, you will see the letters you pressed and the word will start to unfold.  Incorrect letters will show up under 'Wrong Guesses'.  You are allowed seven wrong letter guesses before the game ends.  If you either win or lose, the answer will be revealed.

Press any key to begin and good luck!
